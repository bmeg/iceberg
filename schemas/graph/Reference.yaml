    description: An identifier for the target resource. This is used when there is
      no way to reference the other resource directly, either because the entity it
      represents is not available through a FHIR server, or because there is no way
      for the author of the resource to convert a known identifier to an actual location.
      There is no requirement that a Reference.identifier point to something that
      is actually exposed as a FHIR instance, but it SHALL point to a business concept
      that would be expected to be exposed as a FHIR instance, and that instance would
      need to be of a FHIR resource type allowed by the reference.

      base URL, or an absolute URL that resolves to the location where the resource
      is found. The reference may be version specific or not. If the reference is
      not to a FHIR RESTful server, then it should be assumed to be version specific.

      both SHALL be consistent.  The type is the Canonical URL of Resource Definition
      that is the type this reference refers to. References are URLs that are relative
      to http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/ e.g. "Patient" is a reference to
      http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient. Absolute URLs are only allowed
      for logical models (and can only be used in references in logical models, not
      resources).
