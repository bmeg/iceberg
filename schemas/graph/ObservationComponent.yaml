additionalProperties: false
description: Component results. Some observations have multiple component observations.  These
  component observations are expressed as separate code value pairs that share the
  same attributes.  Examples include systolic and diastolic component observations
  for blood pressure measurement and multiple component observations for genetics
  observations. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/ObservationComponent.html]
