additionalProperties: false
description: Investigation to increase healthcare-related patient-independent knowledge.
  A scientific study of nature that sometimes includes processes involved in health
  and disease. For example, clinical trials are research studies that involve people.
  These studies may be related to new ways to screen, prevent, diagnose, and treat
  disease. They may also study certain outcomes and certain groups of people by looking
  at data collected in the past or future. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/ResearchStudy.html]
