$id: Signature
additionalProperties: false
description: A Signature - XML DigSig, JWS, Graphical image of signature, etc.. A
  signature along with supporting context. The signature may be a digital signature
  that is cryptographic in nature, or some other signature acceptable to the domain.
  This other signature may be as simple as a graphical image representing a hand-written
  signature, or a signature ceremony Different signature approaches have different
  utilities. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/Signature.html]
