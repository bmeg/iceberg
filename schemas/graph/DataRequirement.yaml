    description: May be used to represent additional information that is not part
      of the basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and
      use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is
      a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

      effective evaluation. This does not mean that a value is required for this element,
      only that the consuming system must understand the element and be able to provide
      values for it if they are available.   The value of mustSupport SHALL be a FHIRPath
      resolvable on the type of the DataRequirement. The path SHALL consist only of
      identifiers, constant indexers, and .resolve() (see the [Simple FHIRPath Profile](fhirpath.html#simple)
      for full details).
