$id: DataRequirementCodeFilter
additionalProperties: false
description: What codes are expected. Code filters specify additional constraints
  on the data, specifying the value set of interest for a particular element of the
  data. Each code filter defines an additional constraint on the data, i.e. code filters
  are AND'ed, not OR'ed. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/DataRequirementCodeFilter.html]

      the path has a value that is one of the specified codes. If codes are specified
      in addition to a value set, the filter returns items matching a code in the
      value set or one of the specified codes.

      use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is
      a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

    description: The code-valued attribute of the filter. The specified path SHALL
      be a FHIRPath resolvable on the specified type of the DataRequirement, and SHALL
      consist only of identifiers, constant indexers, and .resolve(). The path is
      allowed to contain qualifiers (.) to traverse sub-elements, as well as indexers
      ([x]) to traverse multiple-cardinality sub-elements (see the [Simple FHIRPath
      Profile](fhirpath.html#simple) for full details). Note that the index must be
      an integer constant. The path must resolve to an element of type code, Coding,
      or CodeableConcept.
