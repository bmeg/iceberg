description: "A reference to a document. A reference to a document of any kind for\
  \ any purpose. While the term \u201Cdocument\u201D implies a more narrow focus,\
  \ for this resource this \"document\" encompasses *any* serialized object with a\
  \ mime-type, it includes formal patient-centric documents (CDA), clinical notes,\
  \ scanned paper, non-patient specific documents like policy text, as well as a photo,\
  \ video, or audio recording acquired or used in healthcare.  The DocumentReference\
  \ resource provides metadata about the document so that the document can be discovered\
  \ and managed.  The actual content may be inline base64 encoded data or provided\
  \ by direct reference. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/DocumentReference.html]"

      DocumentReference.meta.security contains the security labels of the data elements
      in DocumentReference, while DocumentReference.securityLabel contains the security
      labels for the document the reference refers to. The distinction recognizes
      that the document may contain sensitive information, while the DocumentReference
      is metadata about the document and thus might not be as sensitive as the document.
      For example: a psychotherapy episode may contain highly sensitive information,
      while the metadata may simply indicate that some episode happened.'
