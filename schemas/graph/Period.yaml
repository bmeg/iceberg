      no end was known or planned at the time the instance was created. The start
      may be in the past, and the end date in the future, which means that period
      is expected/planned to end at that time.

      of the basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and

      use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is
      a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
