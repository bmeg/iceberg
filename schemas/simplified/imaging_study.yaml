description: A set of images produced in single study (one or more series of references
  images). Representation of the content produced in a DICOM imaging study. A study
  comprises a set of series, each of which includes a set of Service-Object Pair Instances
  (SOP Instances - images or other data) acquired or produced in a common context.  A
  series is of only one modality (e.g. X-ray, CT, MR, ultrasound), but a study may
  have multiple series of different modalities. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/ImagingStudy.html]
