additionalProperties: false
description: An action that is being or was performed on an individual or entity.
  An action that is or was performed on or for a patient, practitioner, device, organization,
  or location. For example, this can be a physical intervention on a patient like
  an operation, or less invasive like long term services, counseling, or hypnotherapy.  This
  can be a quality or safety inspection for a location, organization, or device.  This
  can be an accreditation procedure on a practitioner for licensing. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/Procedure.html]
