$id: ObservationReferenceRange
additionalProperties: false
description: Provides guide for interpretation. Guidance on how to interpret the value
  by comparison to a normal or recommended range.  Multiple reference ranges are interpreted
  as an "OR". In other words, to represent two distinct target populations, two `referenceRange`
  elements would be used. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/ObservationReferenceRange.html]

      African American females, both a code of female and a code for African American
      would be used.
