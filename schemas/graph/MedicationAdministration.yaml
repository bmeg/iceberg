description: Administration of medication to a patient. Describes the event of a patient
  consuming or otherwise being administered a medication.  This may be as simple as
  swallowing a tablet or it may be a long running infusion.  Related resources tie
  this event to the authorizing prescription, and the specific encounter between patient
  and health care practitioner. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/MedicationAdministration.html]
