description: A measured or measurable amount. A measured amount (or an amount that
  can potentially be measured). Note that measured amounts include amounts that are
  not precisely quantified, including amounts involving arbitrary units and floating

      a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
