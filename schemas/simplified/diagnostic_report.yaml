description: A Diagnostic report - a combination of request information, atomic results,
  images, interpretation, as well as formatted reports. The findings and interpretation
  of diagnostic tests performed on patients, groups of patients, products, substances,
  devices, and locations, and/or specimens derived from these. The report includes
  clinical context such as requesting provider information, and some mix of atomic
  results, images, textual and coded interpretations, and formatted representation
  of diagnostic reports. The report also includes non-clinical context such as batch
  analysis and stability reporting of products and substances. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/DiagnosticReport.html]
