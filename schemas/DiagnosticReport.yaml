  A Diagnostic report - a combination of request information, atomic results,

  images, interpretation, as well as formatted reports.

  The findings and interpretation of diagnostic tests performed on patients,

  groups of patients, products, substances, devices, and locations, and/or

  specimens derived from these. The report includes clinical context such as

  requesting provider information, and some mix of atomic results, images,

  textual and coded interpretations, and formatted representation of

  diagnostic reports. The report also includes non-clinical context such as

  batch analysis and stability reporting of products and substances.'
