$id: Timing
additionalProperties: false
description: A timing schedule that specifies an event that may occur multiple times.
  Specifies an event that may occur multiple times. Timing schedules are used to record
  when things are planned, expected or requested to occur. The most common usage is
  in dosage instructions for medications. They are also used when planning care of
  various kinds, and may be used for reporting the schedule to which past regular
  activities were carried out. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/Timing.html]

    description: A code for the timing schedule (or just text in code.text). Some
      codes such as BID are ubiquitous, but many institutions define their own additional
      codes. If a code is provided, the code is understood to be a complete statement
      of whatever is specified in the structured timing data, and either the code
      or the data may be used to interpret the Timing, with the exception that .repeat.bounds
      still applies over the code (and is not contained in the code).

      To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance
      applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can
      define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part

      to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the
      meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change
      the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
