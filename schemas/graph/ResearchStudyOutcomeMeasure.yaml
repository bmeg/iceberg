$id: ResearchStudyOutcomeMeasure
additionalProperties: false
description: A variable measured during the study. An "outcome measure", "endpoint",
  "effect measure" or "measure of effect" is a specific measurement or observation
  used to quantify the effect of experimental variables on the participants in a study,
  or for observational studies, to describe patterns of diseases or traits or associations
  with exposures, risk factors or treatment. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/ResearchStudyOutcomeMeasure.html]

      To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance
      applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can
      define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part
      of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required
      to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the
      meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change
      the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
