description: 'Defined path through the study for a subject. Describes an expected
  event or sequence of events for one of the subjects of a study. E.g. for a living
  subject: exposure to drug A, wash-out, exposure to drug B, wash-out, follow-up.
  E.g. for a stability study: {store sample from lot A at 25 degrees for 1 month},
  {store sample from lot A at 40 degrees for 1 month}. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/ResearchStudyComparisonGroup.html]'

      applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can
      define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part

      to check for modifier extensions.  Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the
      meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change
