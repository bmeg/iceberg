$id: DataRequirementDateFilter
additionalProperties: false
description: What dates/date ranges are expected. Date filters specify additional
  constraints on the data in terms of the applicable date range for specific elements.
  Each date filter specifies an additional constraint on the data, i.e. date filters
  are AND'ed, not OR'ed. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/DataRequirementDateFilter.html]

  extension:
    description: May be used to represent additional information that is not part
      of the basic definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and
      managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and
      use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is
      a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

    description: The date-valued attribute of the filter. The specified path SHALL
      be a FHIRPath resolvable on the specified type of the DataRequirement, and SHALL
      consist only of identifiers, constant indexers, and .resolve(). The path is
      allowed to contain qualifiers (.) to traverse sub-elements, as well as indexers
      ([x]) to traverse multiple-cardinality sub-elements (see the [Simple FHIRPath
      Profile](fhirpath.html#simple) for full details). Note that the index must be
      an integer constant. The path must resolve to an element of type date, dateTime,
      Period, Schedule, or Timing.
